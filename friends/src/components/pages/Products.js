      <h2>I'll be there for you </h2>
      <p>So no one told you life was gonna be this way<br/>
  Your job's a joke, you're broke
  Your love life's DOA<br/>
  It's like you're always stuck in second gear<br/>
  When it hasn't been your day, your week, your month
  Or even your year,<br/> but
  I'll be there for you
  (When the rain starts to pour)<br/>
  I'll be there for you
  (Like I've been there before)<br/>
  I'll be there for you
  ('Cause you're there for me too)<br/>
  You're still in bed at ten
  And work began at eight<br/>
  You've burned your breakfast
  So far, things are going great<br/>
  Your mother warned you there'd be days like these<br/>
  But she didn't tell you when the world has brought
  You down to your knees that<br/>
  I'll be there for you
  (When the rain starts to pour)<br/>
  I'll be there for you
  (Like I've been there before)<br/>
  I'll be there for you
  ('Cause you're there for me too)<br/>
  No one could ever know me
  No one could ever see me<br/>
  Seems you're the only one who knows
  What it's like to be me<br/>
  Someone to face the day with
  Make it through all the rest with<br/>
  Someone I'll always laugh with
  Even at my worst, I'm best with you, yeah<br/>
  It's like you're always stuck in second gear
  When it hasn't been your day, your week, your month
  Or even your year<br/>
  I'll be there for you
  (When the rain starts to pour)<br/>
  I'll be there for you
  (Like I've been there before)<br/>
  I'll be there for you
  ('Cause you're there for me too)<br/>
  I'll be there for you
  I'll be there for you
  I'll be there for you
  ('Cause you're there for me too)<br/>
